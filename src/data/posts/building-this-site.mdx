# The Goal

I set out to learn and build a modern jamstack website that would begin as a web resume of sorts
-- later to expand upon and showcase projects, this blog, maybe more. My goal was to gain enough
experience with jamstack that I would feel confident enough to spin up any sort of websites
that the future me might need. The web dev world out there is vast, yet the skills I’ve learned
with this small project alone should allow me to rapidly build SEO friendly sites with basic
requirements and moderate functionality. Above are some of the pages I built showing both light
and dark mode. Here’s how I approached each step of the build.

# The Stack

The choice became easy merely at the cost of reading a thousand reddit and forum posts. I needed a
stack that would cooperate well with my simple hobby needs yet give me the capability to scale beyond
if desired. NextJS was calling to me at every turn. I also knew firebase would be an easy-to-setup
choice if I needed to add authentication or a nosql database in the future.

[**NextJS**](https://nextjs.org/) - The React framework. This allowed me to do the frontend and basic
backend at the same time. I wanted to learn React and get a general refresh on JavaScript so this choice
was perfect -- reading related posts and the docs detailing it’s various other capabilities sealed the deal.
I based the rest of the stack off of this choice.

[**TailwindCSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Makes all the frontend work so much more pleasant.
I truly recommend this approach to CSS if you have never tried it. Conveniently it goes hand in hand with Next
since the docs mention it and give a boilerplate app to get started.

[**Vercel**](https://vercel.com/) - Hosting solution. This has to be the most seamless way to launch
a Next app.
They created Next framework so it makes sense that they have those needs covered.
My other contender was AWS because I am already familiar and it’s economical to scale,
but ultimately Vercel won due to it’s wonderfully easy deployment for this Next-based stack.

[**Figma**](https://www.figma.com/) - UI Mockup. Great for playing around with the structure and inspiring
designs beforehand. I saved myself from many soul-sucking hours of fiddling with CSS by sticking to the mockup.
You can also draw and export simple svg files from your mockup.

# Learning

I needed a solid refresh on vanilla JavaScript and I have never used React in a project.
I ran through the CodeAcademy courses for both JS and React and was feeling prepared enough to begin
on a Next project. I found what helped the most was looking at some of Lee Robinson’s
[posts](https://leerob.io/) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/MaStaleee/videos), reading from
the NextJS [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextjs/), and deploying and poking around some
examples from the Next example [GitHub repo](https://GitHub.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples).
I really liked the minimal style of Lee Robinson’s blog website so I heavily “borrowed”
that style for this website design step.

# Design

Figma is just great. If you’re making a website I’d highly recommend finding your desired design
by playing around in Figma first. There’s almost no learning curve especially if you’ve used
apps like photoshop or illustrator before. The UI just makes sense to me and here’s a screenshot
while I was designing one of the web pages.

Update: Since my deployment the Figma team unfortunately added constraints to the free tier account
and now only allow 3 files with 3 pages each, previously unlimited. Unlimited was just the right
amount.

# Develop

I began by cloning the
[Next with Tailwind example](https://GitHub.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-tailwindcss)
which just saves about 10 minutes of setting Tailwind up from scratch. I made sure to then install
some relevant eslint rules so my code didn’t immediately become spaghetti. I found
[this eslint plugin](https://GitHub.com/manovotny/eslint-plugin-get-off-my-lawn)
mentioned in one of Lee’s videos. Here is my eslint config file for the project:

```js:.eslintrc.js
module.exports = {
  extends: 'get-off-my-lawn',
  rules: {
    'react/display-name': 0,
    'react/react-in-jsx-scope': 0,
    'react/jsx-no-literals': 0,
    'no-param-reassign': 0,
    'node/no-unpublished-require': 0,
    'jsx-ally/anchor-is-valid': 0,
    semi: 'never',
  },
};
```

I had an idea of the modules I planned on using, so I installed them via `yarn add <module>`. Here
are the packages I ended up installing:

```json:package.json
...
  "dependencies": {
    "@tailwindcss/typography": "^0.4.1",
    "date-fns": "^2.21.3",
    "gray-matter": "^4.0.3",
    "mdx-prism": "^0.3.3",
    "next": "^10.2.0",
    "next-mdx-remote": "^3.0.2",
    "next-themes": "^0.0.14",
    "react": "^17.0.1",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.1",
    "remark-code-titles": "^0.1.2",
    "remark-slug": "^6.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "autoprefixer": "^10.2.5",
    "eslint": "^7.24.0",
    "eslint-config-get-off-my-lawn": "^6.0.1",
    "postcss": "^8.2.10",
    "rehype": "^11.0.0",
    "tailwindcss": "^2.1.1"
  }
}
```

Then I started throwing in my jsx and building the structure of the pages based on my design.
Everything on the initial site can be static so I went with the SSG route for my pages.
I pulled up my Figma window, VSCode, and the browser which gave me one view to hackathon this website
in short time. This part was truly a delightful development experience using the Next + Tailwind
flow -- frankly I don’t think I could go back to any other web development flow.

This setup was excellent for productivity. From a design, you could build a website in a matter of a
couple days. If you’re just starting out like I was but without a project in mind, I’d recommend
building a clone of a website as practice. Lee’s got a video of him doing just that on a live
stream cloning the Netflix landing page and authentication in just over an hour. Check it out,
it provides a quick and digestible view of the power of Next + Tailwind, (Lee’s netflix video link).

# Dark Mode

After that breeze of setting up the main pages I added a dark mode toggle, another task made very
easy by Tailwind. This module (link to dark mode module) along with the docs (link to tailwind docs)
gave a clear walkthrough of setting it up. Then it’s just a matter of creating a \_document.js page
and adding this line, selecting your preferred darkmode colors, and adding them into the jsx using
the class prefix `dark:`

```js:_document.js
import Document, { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document'

class MyDocument extends Document {
   render() {
      return (
         <Html lang='en'>
            <Head>
               <link
                  rel='preload'
                  href='/fonts/inter-var-latin.woff2'
                  as='font'
                  type='font/woff2'
                  crossOrigin='anonymous'
               />
            </Head>
            <body className='bg-theme'>
               <Main />
               <NextScript />
            </body>
         </Html>
      )
   }
}

export default MyDocument
```

Just add `dark:` to make css alterations when in dark mode. This code shows how
you would change the text color inside a paragraph depending on if dark mode is toggled:

```Html
<p className='text-black dark:text-pink-500'>
...
```

Using the Tailwind development flow I wanted to design my site mobile-first while making sure to build
responsively for desktop sizes starting at the tablet breakpoint of 768px wide. Effectively building
for two separate sizes and no more -- sweet and simple. My thought going into this was that visitors
would likely be on mobile and web dev trends seemed to lean towared a mobile-first design.

# Adding the Blog

Lastly in the development phase I wanted to add a blog page that would utilize Next’s dynamic routing
and pull blog content from markdown files in the same repository. Initially I wanted to try out
integration with a headless CMS like [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/) or [Strapi.io](https://strapi.io/),
but decided against it since it’d add too much to my site when in reality I don't expect to write
content often -- the small amount of content is much easier handled as markdown files in the same repo.
The structure of my project would look like this:

<Image
   alt={'source code structure'}
   src={'/blog/buiding-this-site/site-structure.jpg'}
   width={296}
   height={512}
/>

The markdown content for the blog would be inside `src/data/posts` while static files,
like images, that go along with the blog post would be in `public/blog/<post_name>` so
that they can be globally referrenced as per the
[NextJS docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/static-file-serving).

Unrelated to the blog but for organizational purposes I also added a `src/components` folder to
host any helper components, a `src/utils` folder to host non-react-component helper functions,
and a `src/styles` folder that basically will only house a `globals.css` file for additional
css needs that go beyond Tailwind's base styles.

I made a choice to use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) as my Markdown flavor. Using something like
MDX allows you to include jsx and React components directly in the markdown and utilize tools
from Next like Next/Link and Next/Image which is great for automatic optimization of images
in browsers. Using a convenient library called
[next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) allowed for easy loading of
mdx content inside of Next's `getStaticProps` function on your `[slug].js` page.

# Deploying

I had tested out deploying to Vercel from their own app examples. This section will be short since
it’s by far the easiest of the steps. The process goes like this:

-  Host your app (or an example app) on [GitHub](https://github.com/)
-  Make a free account on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
-  Link your GitHub repo to Vercel
-  Deploy

Seriously it’s just that easy. Vercel works like magic and I’d absolutely recommend deploying there
if you have a small to medium sized application. The [free tier](https://vercel.com/pricing)
should be enough for a great percentage of the websites out there. Now when you push code to the
repo and make a pull request Vercel will automatically pick up on that and provide a preview url
for the pages. Merging the pull request to your main branch will then tell Vercel to go ahead
and deploy. It’s just so ridiculously easy.

# Conclusion

This project gave me a chance to freshen up on my Javascript, learn more React, learn about NextJS,
and some useful tools to spin up hobby websites rapidly and cleanly. I also learned that my writing
is absolute trash but hopefully gets the points across. I’m hopeful that more posts will eventually
shift my writing from trash into treasure. If there is a conclusion to draw from this post it’s that
you should absolutely try out a small project using NextJS and Tailwind.
