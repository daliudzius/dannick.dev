# [dannick.dev](https://dannick.dev) - My Personal Site

This website houses information about me, my resume, and a blog. It was built with:

[**NextJS**](https://nextjs.org/) - The React framework. This allowed me to do the frontend and basic
backend at the same time. I wanted to learn React and get a general refresh on JavaScript so this choice
was perfect -- reading related posts and the docs detailing it’s various other capabilities sealed the deal.
I based the rest of the stack off of this choice.

[**TailwindCSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Makes all the frontend work so much more pleasant.
I truly recommend this approach to CSS if you have never tried it. Conveniently it goes hand in hand with Next
since the docs mention it and give a boilerplate app to get started.

[**Vercel**](https://vercel.com/) - Hosting solution. This has to be the most seamless way to launch
a Next app.
They created Next framework so it makes sense that they have those needs covered.
My other contender was AWS because I am already familiar and it’s economical to scale,
but ultimately Vercel won due to it’s wonderfully easy deployment for this Next-based stack.

[**Figma**](https://www.figma.com/) - UI Mockup. Great for playing around with the structure and inspiring
designs beforehand. I saved myself from many soul-sucking hours of fiddling with CSS by sticking to the mockup.
You can also draw and export simple svg files from your mockup.
